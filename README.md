Overall idea is to have a Q&A bot to answer questions with regard to skin care ingredients.
And to answer/ predict whether it's safe for prenatal, pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Currently ( Apr2,2023), it has a mininum flask webpage to take input and answer it. Underneath is a small chatGPT2 model.
The domain model trained model is only on tiny data and the model is not tuned enough and is not used in the web page.

As of next step, will train the model on more data for more epochs and try to used in the web application.
